The Barzilai and Borwein (BB) algorithm is a powerful optimization algorithm that is particularly useful for non-quadratic or non-convex functions. To determine the step size in the BB algorithm, a non-monotone line search is used, which is designed to minimize a quadratic function. This function is defined as:

φ(α) = f (x − αg) − f (x) − cαgT g

Here, f(x) is the objective function, g is the estimated gradient of f at x, and c is a positive constant that controls the trade-off between the step size and the change in the objective function.

The step size is selected by solving the optimization problem:
min α>0 φ(α)

This problem can be solved analytically by computing:
αk = |xk − xk−1|2 (xk − xk−1)T (gk − gk−1)

where |.| denotes the Euclidean norm, xk is the solution vector at iteration k, and gk is the estimated gradient of f at xk. This update rule ensures that the step size is inversely proportional to the dot product of the difference between the solution vectors and the difference between the gradient estimates. By selecting the appropriate step size, the BB algorithm can effectively escape local minima and find better solutions for non-quadratic or non-convex optimization problems [26].

The step size is inversely proportional to the dot product of the difference between the solution vectors and the difference between the gradient estimates. The algorithm iteratively updates the solution vector x by using the estimated gradient g and the non-monotone step size that takes into account the past few iterations of the algorithm.

To apply the BB algorithm, we must first initialize the algorithm by choosing an initial point x0, a step size α0, and a tolerance ε > 0. Then, we compute the gradient gk of the function f at the current point xk and compute the next iterate xk+1 by the formula. We compute the step size αk+1 using the Barzilai-Borwein formula and, if |gk+1| < ε, stop the algorithm and return xk+1 as the solution. Otherwise, we set k = k + 1 and repeat from Step 2.

Note that the choice of the initial point, the search directions, and the stopping criterion are problem-dependent and may require some trial and error. The BB algorithm is usually applied to unconstrained optimization problems and may require some modifications for constrained problems. The algorithm has been shown to have fast convergence rates and good numerical stability properties in practice.

The Barzilai and Borwein method can also be applied to non-linear optimization problems by approximating the Hessian with a suitable matrix. However, the convergence properties of the method are not as well understood in the non-linear case. To update the solution vector x, we use the following update rule.

The step size βk in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm is obtained from the gradient estimate gk and the non-monotone gain sequence. This gain sequence is chosen to satisfy certain conditions and is typically non-monotone, allowing the algorithm to escape local minima and find better solutions. The step size βk is computed as follows [26]:



where γk is a non-monotone gain sequence that is typically chosen to satisfy certain conditions, ||gk|| is the norm of the gradient estimate, and ||∆k|| is the norm of the perturbation vector [26].

The Barzilai and Borwein algorithm has been shown to be effective for minimizing non-convex, ill-conditioned functions. The non-monotone gain sequence allows the algorithm to escape from local minima and find better solutions [26].

**QUADRATIC FUNCTION**

where f (x) is the objective function, g is the estimated gradient of f at x, and c is a positive constant. The parameter c controls the trade-off between the step size and the change in the objective function. A larger value of c leads to smaller steps, while a smaller value leads to larger steps [26]

The step size is inversely proportional to the dot product of the difference between the solution vectors and the difference between the gradient estimates. The algorithm iteratively updates the solution vector x by using the estimated gradient g and the non-monotone step size that takes into account the past few iterations of the algorithm.
