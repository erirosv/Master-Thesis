Cross-validation is a powerful technique for assessing the performance of a machine learning model when the amount of available data is limited. It involves dividing the available data into k non-overlapping folds, each containing approximately the same number of instances. The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the fold that was held out. This process is repeated k times, with each fold being used exactly once as the test set, to provide a reliable estimate of the model's generalization performance [42], [43].

One of the main advantages of cross-validation is that it allows us to assess the performance of a model more reliably than using a single train-test split. By using multiple splits of the data, we can get a better sense of how well the model will perform on unseen data. Additionally, cross-validation can help us to tune the hyperparameters of a model, such as the learning rate in a neural network or the number of trees in a random forest. By assessing the model's performance for different hyperparameter values, we can select the best settings [42], [43].

The mathematical definition of the k-fold cross-validation algorithm involves using a dataset D with n instances and corresponding labels, dividing it into k non-overlapping folds, and iteratively training and testing the model on different folds to assess its performance [42], [43].

**ALGORITHM 1**

The algorithm ensures that each instance in the dataset is used for testing exactly once and that the model is trained on all the other instances. The algorithm can be expressed mathematically as follows:

Overall, cross-validation is a widely used technique in machine learning that provides a reliable estimate of a model's generalization performance. This allows us to make better use of our data and make more informed decisions about which models to use and how to tune them. The mathematical definition of the k-fold cross-validation algorithm involves using a dataset D with n instances and corresponding labels, dividing it into k non-overlapping folds, and iteratively training and testing the model on different folds to assess its performance [42], [43].
