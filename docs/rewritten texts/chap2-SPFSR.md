The SPSFR algorithm is a feature selection technique that seeks to improve a model's performance by selecting a subset of features from a larger set. To accomplish this, the algorithm employs a stochastic approximation approach that involves randomly selecting a subset of features and evaluating the model's performance with that subset.

To update the feature subset, the algorithm computes the importance weight for each feature based on the performance improvement obtained by adding or removing that feature from the subset. Specifically, the algorithm updates a weight vector of size k at each iteration t, where wt,i is the importance weight of the i-th feature in the subset St. Initially, all weights are set to 1/k.

The algorithm then updates the weights based on the performance improvement obtained by adding or removing a feature i from St. If adding feature i improves performance, then wt+1,i = wt,i × (1 + γ), where γ is a small positive constant. If removing feature i improves performance, then wt+1,i = wt,i ×(1−γ). Otherwise, wt+1,i = wt,i. Note that the sum of the weights is always equal to 1.

After updating the weights, the algorithm selects the new subset St+1 by sampling k features from X with replacement, where each feature i is selected with probability proportional to its weight wt+1,i. The algorithm repeats this process for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence and returns the best subset of features based on the performance measure.

Overall, the SPSFR algorithm is a stochastic search algorithm that iteratively updates a set of importance weights for the features and uses these weights to sample new subsets of features. The goal is to converge to a good subset of features that maximizes the performance measure.
