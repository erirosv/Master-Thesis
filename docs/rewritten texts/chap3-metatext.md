In the field of machine learning, classification is a widely used supervised learning technique. Its objective is to build a function that maps input variables to output variables, where the output variable represents a class or category. Typically, input variables are a set of features or attributes that describe the objects or instances being classified. Various practical applications, such as image recognition, spam filtering, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis, utilize classification [42].

To achieve accurate and reliable classification results, data scientists must carefully prepare the data, perform feature engineering, and select appropriate classification algorithms. Skiena (2017) discusses the strengths and limitations of several popular classification algorithms, including decision trees, logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks [42].

**IGNORE SUMMARY**
In summary, classification is a powerful data science tool with a wide range of practical applications. However, obtaining accurate and robust classification results requires careful data preprocessing and the selection of appropriate classification algorithms. Skiena's examination of popular classification algorithms can provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches [42].
