SPSA is a powerful optimization algorithm that is used for problems with noisy, black-box objective functions. The algorithm uses random perturbations to estimate the gradient of the objective function and then performs a stochastic approximation update to find the optimal solution. To ensure the convergence of the algorithm, the step size sequence αk is typically chosen to satisfy the Robbins-Monro conditions. One common choice for the step size sequence is:

where ak, bk, and γ are constants that depend on the problem, and k is the iteration number.

The SPSA algorithm is a stochastic optimization algorithm that aims to find the optimal solution vector x∗ for a given objective function f (x). At each iteration, the algorithm generates random perturbation vectors and uses them to estimate the gradient of the objective function. The solution vector is then updated using a stochastic approximation update. The process repeats until the termination criterion is satisfied. The output of the algorithm is the optimal solution vector x∗.

**IGNORE SUMMARY**
In summary, the SPSA algorithm is a powerful and efficient optimization algorithm that can handle noisy, black-box objective functions. The algorithm uses random perturbations to estimate the gradient of the objective function and performs a stochastic approximation update to find the optimal solution. The Robbins-Monro conditions are used to ensure the convergence of the algorithm, and the step size sequence is chosen accordingly. The SPSA algorithm is an iterative process that generates a sequence of solution vectors until the termination criterion is met, and the optimal solution vector is the final output of the algorithm.
