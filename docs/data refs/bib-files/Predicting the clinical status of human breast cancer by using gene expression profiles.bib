abstract = {Prognostic and predictive factors are indispensable tools in
 the treatment of patients with neoplastic disease. For the most part,
 such factors rely on a few specific cell surface, histological, or
 gross pathologic features. Gene expression assays have the potential to
 supplement what were previously a few distinct features with many
 thousands of features. We have developed Bayesian regression models
 that provide predictive capability based on gene expression data
 derived from DNA microarray analysis of a series of primary breast
 cancer samples. These patterns have the capacity to discriminate breast
 tumors on the basis of estrogen receptor status and also on the
 categorized lymph node status. Importantly, we assess the utility and
 validity of such models in predicting the status of tumors in
 crossvalidation determinations. The practical value of such approaches
 relies on the ability not only to assess relative probabilities of
 clinical outcomes for future samples but also to provide an honest
 assessment of the uncertainties associated with such predictive
 classifications on the basis of the selection of gene subsets for each
 validation analysis. This latter point is of critical importance in the
 ability to apply these methodologies to clinical assessment of tumor
 phenotype.}}
