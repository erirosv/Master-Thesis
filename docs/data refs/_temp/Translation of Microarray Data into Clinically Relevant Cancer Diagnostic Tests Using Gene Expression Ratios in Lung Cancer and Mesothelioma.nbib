AB  - The pathological distinction between malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)and 
      adenocarcinoma (ADCA) of the lung can be cumbersome using established methods. We 
      propose that a simple technique, based on the expression levels of a small number 
      of genes, can be useful in the early and accurate diagnosis of MPM and lung 
      cancer. This method is designed to accurately distinguish between genetically 
      disparate tissues using gene expression ratios and rationally chosen thresholds. 
      Here we have tested the fidelity of ratio-based diagnosis in differentiating 
      between MPM and lung cancer in 181 tissue samples (31 MPM and 150 ADCA). A 
      training set of 32 samples (16 MPM and 16 ADCA) was used to identify pairs of 
      genes with highly significant, inversely correlated expression levels to form a 
      total of 15 diagnostic ratios using expression profiling data. Any single ratio 
      of the 15 examined was at least 90% accurate in predicting diagnosis for the 
      remaining 149 samples (e.g., test set). We then examined (in the test set) the 
      accuracy of multiple ratios combined to form a simple diagnostic tool. Using two 
      and three expression ratios, we found that the differential diagnoses of MPM and 
      lung ADCA were 95% and 99% accurate, respectively. We propose that using gene 
      expression ratios is an accurate and inexpensive technique with direct clinical 
      applicability for distinguishing between MPM and lung cancer. Furthermore, we 
      provide evidence suggesting that this technique can be equally accurate in other 
      clinical scenarios.
