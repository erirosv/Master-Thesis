> These studies demonstrate how microarray data can be used to diagnose neurological disorders, understand the genetic basis of diseases such as multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis, and identify different molecular subtypes of cancer. By providing doctors with valuable information about a patient's genetics and disease status, microarray data can help guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.

Amplification is an essential step in microarray analysis, as the amount of RNA
that can be extracted from a single sample is often limited. However, traditional
amplification methods, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), can introduce
amplification biases that can affect the accuracy and reliability of the microarray
data (the PCR method is described in Appendix A.1). To overcome these issues,
new amplification methods, such as linear amplification and template-switching-
based amplification, have been developed. Linear amplification uses a modified T7
polymerase to amplify RNA in a linear manner, which reduces amplification bias
and improves the accuracy of microarray data (van Heesch et al., 2013). Template-
switching-based amplification is another method that uses reverse transcriptase to
add a template-switching oligo to the 3â€™ end of cDNA, which allows for the amplifi-
cation of full-length cDNA transcripts and reduces amplification bias (Picelli et al.,
2014).
