Microarray data analysis has emerged as a significant area of research in biomedical informatics due to the growing availability of high-throughput gene expression data. The identification of relevant features from these datasets is essential for understanding biological mechanisms and developing diagnostic and prognostic tools for diseases like cancer. Several feature selection algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address this challenge. In the following paragraphs, we review and compare some state-of-the-art feature selection methods for microarray data analysis.

One method we consider is the RFC-based feature selection algorithm proposed by Nuklianggraita et al. The authors employed RFC to identify important genes for cancer detection from microarray data and showed that their algorithm outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. This method is an excellent starting point for feature selection in microarray data analysis.

Another popular approach for feature selection in microarray data analysis is the use of filter methods. Bolón-Canedo et al. conducted a comprehensive review of microarray datasets and applied feature selection methods, including filter methods such as t-test, mutual information, and correlation-based feature selection. Their study highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each method and provided guidelines for selecting appropriate feature selection techniques based on the characteristics of the dataset. The study by Bolón-Canedo et al. complements the RFC-based feature selection method as it provides a broader understanding of different filter methods.

Wrapper–Filter feature selection algorithms have been proposed to combine the strengths of both wrapper and filter methods. Zhu et al. presented a Memetic Framework that integrates both wrapper and filter methods for feature selection in microarray data analysis. Their algorithm outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. The wrapper–filter method presented by Zhu et al. builds upon the strengths of the RFC-based feature selection method and the filter methods discussed by Bolón-Canedo et al. It is an interesting approach to consider for microarray data analysis.

In an attempt to combine the strengths of both wrapper and filter methods, Zhu et al. proposed a Memetic Framework for feature selection in microarray data analysis. The algorithm builds upon the RFC-based feature selection method and the filter methods discussed by Bolón-Canedo et al. Their approach outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. This hybrid wrapper-filter approach is an interesting alternative for microarray data analysis.

Another widely used approach for feature selection in microarray data analysis is the Information-Theoretic method. Meyer et al. proposed a variable complementarity-based feature selection method that utilizes the information content of genes to identify relevant features. Their study demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. This information-theoretic approach complements the hybrid wrapper-filter approach presented by Zhu et al.

Hybrid wrapper-filter feature selection algorithms have also been proposed to combine the best features selected by filter and wrapper methods. Apolloni et al. presented two hybrid wrapper-filter feature selection algorithms, which outperformed other methods in terms of classification accuracy and stability. Their approach is interesting as it combines the advantages of both wrapper and filter methods. It is worth noting that their method complements the hybrid wrapper-filter method proposed by Zhu et al.

Comparative studies of different machine learning methods for microarray data analysis have also been conducted. Pirooznia et al. compared several machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and naive Bayes, for feature selection. They concluded that, in contrast to filter-based approaches, wrapper methods evaluate a subset of features by testing the classifier's performance, resulting in a more accurate feature subset selection. The wrapper-filter algorithm proposed by Zexuan Zhu et al. uses a memetic framework to combine both wrapper and filter methods, leading to a hybrid solution that achieves high classification accuracy and low computational cost. This is particularly relevant in microarray data analysis, where the number of features is often very high.

Another information-theoretic feature selection approach is the variable complementarity method proposed by Meyer et al. (2011). This method uses mutual information to measure the dependence between a feature and a class label and the complementary variable to measure the dependence between features. The complementarity variable aims to reduce the redundancy between the features by maximizing the difference in the mutual information values. The results of the experiments demonstrated that the variable complementarity method outperformed other information-theoretic methods in terms of classification accuracy and number of features selected. This approach complements the hybrid wrapper-filter and the traditional filter and wrapper methods discussed earlier.

Javier Apolloni et al. (2018) proposed two hybrid wrapper-filter algorithms that combine the strengths of both methods. These algorithms use a feature ranking method as a filter and a greedy search method as a wrapper to select the best features. The results showed that the hybrid methods outperformed both the wrapper and filter methods alone in terms of classification accuracy and feature selection.

Mehdi Pirooznia et al. (2008) conducted a comparative study of different machine learning methods for microarray data analysis, including decision trees, SVM, and Naïve Bayes, and evaluated their performance with different feature selection methods.

Li-Yeh Chuang et al. (2008) proposed a hybrid feature selection method that combines filter and wrapper methods. This method first filters the features using a correlation-based feature selection method and then uses a sequential backward selection wrapper method to evaluate the remaining features. The results showed that the hybrid method outperformed both the filter and wrapper methods alone in terms of classification accuracy and number of selected features.

Manosij Ghosh et al. (2015) proposed a genetic algorithm-based ensemble of filter methods to identify cancerous genes from microarray data. This approach combines different filter methods, such as correlation-based, t-test, and mutual information-based methods, to identify the most relevant genes. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed other filter methods in terms of classification accuracy and number of selected genes.

V. Bolón-Canedo et al. (2011) proposed a distributed feature selection approach to address the high-dimensional and distributed nature of microarray data. The approach consists of a filter method that uses mutual information to measure the relevance of features and a wrapper method that uses a distributed evolutionary algorithm to search for the optimal feature subset. The experiments showed that the distributed approach outperformed other feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy and computational time.

Yu Wang et al. (2006) proposed a machine learning approach for gene selection from microarray data for cancer classification, which used a wrapper method. This method combined a genetic algorithm with a SVM classifier to select the most relevant genes. The study found that their approach outperformed other feature selection methods in terms of classification accuracy and number of selected genes.

In comparison, V. Bolón-Canedo et al. (2011) proposed a distributed feature selection approach to address the high-dimensional and distributed nature of microarray data. The approach used a filter method based on mutual information to measure the relevance of features and a wrapper method that employed a distributed evolutionary algorithm to search for the optimal feature subset. The study demonstrated that their distributed approach outperformed other feature selection methods in terms of both classification accuracy and computational time.

To balance accuracy and computational efficiency, researchers have proposed hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both filter and wrapper methods. Patrick Emmanuel Meyer et al. (2011) proposed the Variable Complementarity-based Feature Selection (VCFS) method that used mutual information and redundancy measures to evaluate the relevance and redundancy of each feature.
