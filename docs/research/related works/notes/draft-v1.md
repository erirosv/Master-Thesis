In this chapter, we review and compare different feature selection techniques for cancer classification using microarray gene expression data. Feature selection is an essential step in machine learning tasks that deal with high-dimensional data. It aims to identify the most informative and relevant features while discarding the redundant ones, leading to improved model performance and interpretability.

To begin, we divide feature selection methods into two categories, those based on information theory and those that are not. The methods based on information theory use statistical measures to evaluate the relevance and redundancy of features. These include univariate filter feature selection methods such as Relief and its variant ReliefF, information gain, and other ranking approaches. While these methods are scalable and fast, they ignore feature correlation.

Recent advancements in feature selection methods have aimed to address the limitations of existing techniques. One such approach is multivariate filter feature selection, which selects the optimal feature subset rather than individual relevant features. Another popular approach is wrapper methods, which are tailored to a specific algorithm and domain but can be computationally intensive. Hybrid approaches such as support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), iterative Genetic Algorithm (GA) with SVM, and Pearson correlation coefficient for binning and signal-to-noise ratio for weighted ranking have been suggested to take advantage of both filter and wrapper methods.

However, these hybrid approaches need to be evaluated and compared to other techniques to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The paper by An Efficient SVM-Based Feature Selection Model for Cancer Classification Using High-Dimensional Microarray Data proposed a hybrid approach that uses SVM-RFE to combine filter and wrapper methods. The paper Genetic algorithm based cancerous gene identification from microarray data using ensemble of filter methods proposed an ensemble approach that combines several filter methods. The paper MaskedPainter: Feature selection for microarray data analysis proposed a feature selection method that uses an iterative algorithm to remove redundant and irrelevant features.

Other papers have focused on improving the performance of existing feature selection methods. The paper On the Feature Selection of Microarray Data for Cancer Detection based on Random Forest Classifier proposed a feature selection method that uses random forest to rank features. The paper TotalPLS: Local Dimension Reduction for Multicategory Microarray Data proposed a feature selection method that uses Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression to select features that have a strong relationship with the outcome variable.

A review of microarray datasets and applied feature selection methods provides a comprehensive overview of the most commonly used feature selection methods in microarray data analysis. The paper also highlights the need for more efficient and effective techniques for feature selection that can handle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data. Recently, Alonso et al. proposed a relaxation of maximum accuracy criteria to select the combination of feature selection and classification algorithm that reduces the number of selected features. Their work involved three feature selection methods: two filter methods (FCBF and ReliefF) and one hybrid method (SVM-RFE). This highlights the importance of evaluating and comparing different feature selection methods to identify the most effective approach for a given dataset.

In addition to these methods, several recent advancements have been proposed to address the limitations of existing techniques. For instance, some methods aim to handle the trade-off between relevance and redundancy by selecting a subset of features that are both informative and complementary to each other. One such method is TotalPLS, which combines partial least squares regression and local dimension reduction to select a subset of features that are predictive of the outcome of interest. Similarly, MaskedPainter is a feature selection algorithm that employs a novel masking technique to identify the most relevant features while taking into account feature correlation.

Moreover, there have been efforts to develop feature selection techniques that are more interpretable, which is particularly important in the context of medical applications where the selected features may provide insights into the underlying biological mechanisms. For example, the paper by Zhang et al. proposes a feature selection method based on gene ontology annotations, which allows for the identification of biologically meaningful features. Another study by Zhou et al. suggests a new feature selection approach based on the interpretation of support vector machine (SVM) coefficients, which provides insights into the role of each feature in the classification process.

Overall, the literature on feature selection for high-dimensional datasets is extensive, and there is a wide range of methods available. While univariate filter and wrapper methods are widely used, more advanced techniques such as multivariate filter, hybrid, and relaxation-based methods have also been proposed. These methods aim to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, such as feature correlation, computational complexity, and interpretability of selected features. However, it is important to evaluate and compare these methods on real-world datasets to identify their strengths and weaknesses and to provide guidance for their application in practice.
